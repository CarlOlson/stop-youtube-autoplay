* Stop Youtube Autoplay
A Firefox addon to prevent youtube's autoplay feature. Only tested
with Youtube's HTML5 player.

It works by stopping HTTP requests from Youtube that have a temporary
autoplay cookie.
* Why?
This is useful if you clear cookies on every browser session. There
might have been an easier way, but this was a learning experience.
